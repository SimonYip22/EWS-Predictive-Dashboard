While the current implementation uses a CSV-based synthetic ICU dataset, the system is designed with future integration of healthcare interoperability standards in mind. A logical next step would be to support FHIR-formatted datasets, enabling seamless ingestion of EHR data, standardised resource mapping, and compatibility with hospital systems. This extension would further demonstrate proficiency in HL7/FHIR and real-world clinical workflows.
